Since this question was asked in 2010, there has been real simplification in how to do simple multithreading with python with **map** and **pool**.

The code below comes from an article/blog post that you should definitely check out (no affiliation) - **Parallelism in one line: A Better Model for Day to Day Threading Tasks**. I'll summarize below - it ends up being just a few lines of code:

```Python
from multiprocessing.dummy import Pool as ThreadPool 
pool = ThreadPool(4) 
results = pool.map(my_function, my_array)
```

Which is the multithreaded version of:

```Python
results = []
for item in my_array:
    results.append(my_function(item))
```

------

**Description**

> Map is a cool little function, and the key to easily injecting parallelism into your Python code. For those unfamiliar, map is something lifted from functional languages like Lisp. It is a function which maps another function over a sequence.
>
> Map handles the iteration over the sequence for us, applies the function, and stores all of the results in a handy list at the end.

**Implementation**

> Parallel versions of the map function are provided by two libraries:multiprocessing, and also its little known, but equally fantastic step child:multiprocessing.dummy.

```Python
import urllib2 
from multiprocessing.dummy import Pool as ThreadPool 

urls = [
  'http://www.python.org', 
  'http://www.python.org/about/',
  'http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/python/2003/04/17/metaclasses.html',
  'http://www.python.org/doc/',
  'http://www.python.org/download/',
  'http://www.python.org/getit/',
  'http://www.python.org/community/',
  'https://wiki.python.org/moin/',
  ]

# make the Pool of workers
pool = ThreadPool(4) 

# open the urls in their own threads
# and return the results
results = pool.map(urllib2.urlopen, urls)

# close the pool and wait for the work to finish 
pool.close() 	
pool.join() 	
```

And the timing results:

```Bash
Single thread:   14.4 seconds
       4 Pool:   3.1 seconds
       8 Pool:   1.4 seconds
      13 Pool:   1.3 seconds
```

**Passing multiple arguments** (works like this only in Python 3.3 and later): ([source](https://stackoverflow.com/a/28975239/2327328)):

To pass multiple arrays:

```
results = pool.starmap(function, zip(list_a, list_b))
```

or to pass a constant and an array:

```
results = pool.starmap(function, zip(itertools.repeat(constant), list_a))
```

If you are using an earlier version of Python, you can pass multiple arguments via [this workaround](https://stackoverflow.com/a/5443941/1893275).
